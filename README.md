## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Wassup. I'm Durhat. I'm studying Data and Information Science at the University of Applied Sciences Cologne (*TH KÃ¶ln*). My enthusiasm for coding is indescribable. There is a guy named *Noah* who wanna compete with me but I'd reccomend to not listen to him. He is an absolute gooflord. Coding is my passion and there is nobody better than me.
